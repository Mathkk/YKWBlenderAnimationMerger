# YKWBlenderAnimationMerger
Making animations ports easier for the YKW 3DS Games


# What is this tool?

This is a script for Blender that allows you to merge automatically multiple animations into only one and it logs when those animation frames starts and ends!
The tool was made with the main purpose of helping the Yo-kai Watch Modding Community but it also works for any other animations that you just want to merge.

# How to install and use the tool?
